# Abstract

This project aims to allow an user to control smart home devices using their hands by simply pointing to it.

By using a raspberry pi, a camera, and a Lidar, we are able to first detect a person's fingers, create a depth map, and determine which object the user is pointing to. Then, with a simple command (such as saying "on/off") the smart home device will behave as expected. In addition, we plan on adding a laser pointer to provide the user a visual feedback to which object the system determined he/she is pointing to.
